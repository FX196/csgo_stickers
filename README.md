## CSGO Major Sticker Predictions

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is a competitive PC game. 2-3 times a year there is a CSGO Major. Top 16 teams in the world battle to win large prize pool and fame. People can buy stickers for $1 to support their favorite teams and bet on who will win. The day after the tournament ends, these stickers cost 25 cents, but after that day, the stickers can only be purchased on the online marketplace. Over the next few months the prices of the stickers increase. We use deep learning methods to triple investment over a few month period.
